# JokerLaneDuplicate
A duplicate of the website for Joker lane Race way that is more mobile friendly.

Calendar and pro-driver were left blank/with limited content to reduce uncessary repetition or work.
There was a possibilty this was going to be put into a CMS system so I didnt feel it was necessary to
remake the other pages when an example was complete.

As well some images were not used from the original page to avoid conflict.
